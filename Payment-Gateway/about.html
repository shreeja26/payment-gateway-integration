        <p>Child Aid partners with elementary school teachers and the schools where they work to 
            create vibrant classrooms full of literacy and learning. Our literacy and education programs focus 
            on developing the core literacy skills and habits of reading that are so critical to lifetime learning. 
            We stock classroom shelves with colorful, engaging books, train teachers in literacy instruction and support 
            school programs that give students more opportunities to spend time reading and developing their skills.
        </p>
        <p class="content">Child Aid invests in literacy and education programs because we believe curious kids can change the world.
            We focus on primary schools because learning to read early in life matters.</p>

                    For more than two decades, Child Aid has worked to improve the quality of education in Guatemala’s most poverty-stricken 
                    indigenous communities. From the start, we recognized the link between illiteracy and systemic poverty, and saw the 
                    possibility to make a lasting impact in children’s lives through education.

                    Children who develop basic literacy skills in the early grades, stay in school longer, have better economic
                     opportunities throughout their lives, are more self-sufficient and are better able to adapt to a changing world.

                        Guatemala has some of the highest rates of illiteracy, inequality and poverty in the world, but it also has
                         people with a rich culture and tradition, great strength and capabilities and a desire to work for a better life 
                         for themselves and their children. We work in partnership with Guatemalans to realize our shared vision of a country 
                         with peace and prosperity for all its citizens.

                        <span class="eff">Coaching is the secret of our success.  </span> 
                        We know that working one-on-one with teachers in their classrooms is the key to building better educators. 
                        It’s how we build collaborative trust. It’s how we build the confidence to try new things. It’s how we rally 
                        around our common goal of helping children learn. Through coaching, teachers gain the experience and skills 
                        they need to succeed.
